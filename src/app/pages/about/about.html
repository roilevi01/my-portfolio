    <p>
      I'm <strong>Roi Levi</strong>, a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>
      specializing in building
      <strong>end-to-end, production-ready web applications</strong>.<br />

      I work with technologies such as
      <strong
        >React, Angular, Node.js, C#, .NET Core, MongoDB, and SQL Server</strong
      >, focusing on <strong>clean architecture</strong>,
      <strong>responsive user interfaces</strong>, and
      <strong>robust backend logic</strong>.<br />

      My experience includes developing
      <strong>real-world systems</strong>—from management platforms to
      interactive applications—while emphasizing <strong>UX/UI</strong>,
      <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, <strong>maintainable code</strong>, and
      <strong>system reliability</strong>.<br />

      With strong <strong>attention to detail</strong> and a practical,
      results-driven mindset, I'm a <strong>fast learner</strong> who
      continuously improves and enjoys working both independently and as part of
      a team.
