    <p>
      I'm <strong>Roi Levi</strong>, a <strong>full-stack software developer</strong> passionate about transforming ideas into digital reality.<br />
      I completed a comprehensive development course at <strong>HackerU College</strong>, gaining hands-on experience with technologies like <strong>React, Angular, Node.js, C#, .NET Core, MongoDB, SQL Server, HTML, CSS</strong>, and <strong>SCSS</strong>.<br />
      Throughout the course, I developed a variety of projects—from management systems to interactive games—focusing on <strong>UX/UI design</strong>, <strong>responsive layouts</strong>, <strong>clean code practices</strong>, and <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>.<br />
      I'm a <strong>fast learner</strong> with strong <strong>attention to detail</strong>, always seeking to improve, grow, and contribute to team success.
